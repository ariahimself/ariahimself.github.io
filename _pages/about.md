Hello I am Aria. I completed concurrent Ph.D.s in Electrical and Computer Engineering and in Mathematics at Northeastern University. This unique path has given me a strong foundation at the intersection of rigorous theory and applied research. My current focus is on artificial intelligence interpretability and reliability. I’m interested in opening up black-box models, developing methods that make AI systems more transparent, and applying these ideas to areas like healthcare where trust and accountability matter most. Along the way, I’ve been fortunate to explore these questions through rigorous theoretical work as well as practical experiments and to share the results at venues like NeurIPS, ICLR, and AISTATS.

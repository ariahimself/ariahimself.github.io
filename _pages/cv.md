Work experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant (Sep 2017 - Aug 2024)
  * ECE Department, Northeastern University
  * Interpretability of black box models is often complicated and needs a prodigious amount of analysis. Our collaboration with Harvard medical school enables us to study the applicability of our methods on biomedical data, where we focus on developing novel learning algorithms to aid in the discovery of subtypes of a lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

* Graduate Research Assistant (Sep 2024 - Aug 2025)
